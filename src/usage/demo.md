# Demo

Once you have Enumerion [installed](/installation.md) you can run the executable via `./enumerion.exe`.
This should give you a REPL prompt

```enum
Enumerion
#
```

where you can input [toplevel commands](/enumerion/toplevel.md). Here we'll be focusing mostly on `enumerate`.
This enumerates all the elements of a given type.

It is used as follows:

```enum
# enumerate <expr>
```

where `<expr>` is an enumerion expression.
